    Our RoboTrio wants to play golf, but they are too precious and can shot any hole without problem.
    Thus they changed rules. You should write a function and make it as short as possible.
    The shorter code -- more points.
</p>

<p>
    There are 9 (nine) holes on the square field with size 10x10 units.
    You are given coordinates of the holes.
    For the winning you should find the shortest way through all holes and your function must return the length of this way.
    You are start in the point (0, 0) and can finish in any hole.
    The result will be checked with &plusmn;0.01 precision.

</p>

<p>
    In this mission points that you get are dynamic and related with the length of your code.
    We count all characters. XXX characters is the required minimum.
    For each character minus from basis you will get 1 point. For example for YYY characters in code you will get XXX - YYY points.
        </p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A set of hole coordinates. Each hole coordinates are represented as a tuple of integers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The length of the shortest path as a float.

    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
